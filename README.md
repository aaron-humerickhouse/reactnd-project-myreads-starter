# MyReads Project

This application is a quick way to store your reading list.  It has shelves for "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".  There is also a feature that allows you to search for a book.  Just hit the "+" symbol on the Home Page and start searching.  At any time you want to move a book around, click the down icon to expose the menu.  Look for your desired location and select.
